Flexibility and changeability of assembly processes require a close cooperation between the worker and the automated assembly system. The interaction between human and robots improves the efficiency of individual complex assembly processes, particularly when a robot serves as an intelligent assistant. The paper gives a survey about forms of human-machine cooperation in assembly and available technologies that support the cooperation. Organizational and economic aspects of cooperative assembly including efficient component supply and logistics are also discussed. © 2009 CIRP.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Background: Meat has been an important protein source for human nu-trition for thousands of years and will continue to be. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and Food and Agriculture Organisation's (OECD-FAO)outlook report 2018–2027, the meat consumption increased around 20% in the last ten years, and it is expected to grow another 15% for the next ten years. The harsh working environ-ment in abattoirs and meat factories, such as cold and wet operating rooms and long difficult handling of heavy loads, contributing to the shortage of a skilled labour forces. This, coupled with a considerable increase in the meat consumption, paved the way for novel approaches in the meat industry to ad-dress this challenge, with robotisation and automation of the meat factories being a necessary change. Scope and approach: In this work, we review the current state of robotisa-tion for the meat industry and its adaptability to a new production concept called the meat factory cell (MFC). The reviewed systems are: (a) Frontmatec AiRA Robots for pork slaugh-terlines (b) Mayekawa Hamdas-RX for deboning pork ham; (c) SCOTT Au- tomated Boning Room for lamb slaughterlines; (d) SRDViand (Systemes Robotis'es de D'ecoupe de Viande) Z-cut robotic system to do the separation of the hindquarter and the forequarter; (e) SRDViand ham deboning system; (f) SRDViand ECHORD-DEXDEB, a robotic butcher left hand; (g) SINTEF GRIBBOT, a chicken fillet harvesting robot. Key findings and conclusions: The slaughterhouse processes can be highly automated, with products available at the market, while the meat processing plants are mainly manual; deboning and fine cuts require a higher level of dexterity comparing to primary slaughter cuts, this leads to more researches of intelligent systems. In the other hand, a new way to process the slaughter products can lead to innovation and smarter systems on slaughterhouses, with the benefits to open new opportunities for smaller producers.

Grasping has always been considered a key domain of cyber-physical systems, through which action physical interaction can be achieved. This paper presents a systematic review of the state-of-the-art robotic soft object gripping solutions aimed for the food-industry, focusing on red meat handling. A categorized analysis about the currently used grippers is provided, that could be used or adapted to robotic meat-processing. The paper enlists various solutions and gripping principles for low-payload applications too, although the emphasis is on the classic shape-locking and force-locking grippers that are potentially capable of grasping and manipulating heavier specimens. The purpose of the scientific literature survey is mainly to identify exceptional and/or remarkable gripper-designs, or completely new gripping concepts, while the patent research presents complete, commercially available solutions.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The use of high productivity pruning shears led the market toward the development of electronic controlled pneumatic or electric tools, which improve the ergonomics and the effective field capacity. A vineyard worker can get to make up to 8-10.000 cutting shares per working day. Nevertheless, the high intensity and repetitiveness of the movements, which shall be added to the limitation of workspaces with the constrain of a high precision cuts, gives rise to main two issues i.e. the primary on the safety for the operator, the other related to the potential plant damage. Investigation concerning such tools provided by National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work - INAIL have highlighted for the agricultural sector, on average just under 200 accident per year of partial or sharp cuts of the phalanges. Similarly, a further problem which occurs during the pruning stages in vineyards, is the accidental cutting of trellis wires. On the market, are available some safety systems which, however, do not spread because the non-user-friendliness. After all, the innovations in electronic technology allow realizing devices that can discriminate at any instant and with great accuracy, what is touching the blade of the scissors and lock it if necessary. The present work relates the preliminary evaluation of a safety kit applicable to electrical portable tools with trigger activation or similar progressive regulators. It is made of a safety circuit that interacts with the electronic controller of the tools by using the natural body impedance measurements. An electrical control allows to immediately detecting the materials impedance that come into contact with blade. When accidentally the operator finger's is touching the blade, the impedance value go down quickly, consequently the voltage reading will drop towards a threshold value where a decision block will intervene to stop the closing movement of the blades. The preliminary tests carried out showed the high reliability of the safety stop system, which could represent a feasible active solution for every electrical supplied cutting tools employable in agriculture sector and not just.

 Labor demand in the time of covid-19: Evidence from vacancy postings

<blockquote><font size="-1">
We use job vacancy data collected in real time by Burning Glass Technologies, as well as unemployment insurance (UI) initial claims and the more traditional Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employment data to study the impact of COVID-19 on the labor market. Our job vacancy data allow us to track the economy at disaggregated geography and by detailed occupation and industry. We find that job vacancies collapsed in the second half of March. By late April, they had fallen by over 40%. To a first approximation, this collapse was broad based, hitting all U.S. states, regardless of the timing of stay-at-home policies. UI claims and BLS employment data also largely match these patterns. Nearly all industries and occupations saw contraction in postings and spikes in UI claims, with little difference depending on whether they are deemed essential and whether they have work-from-home capability. Essential retail, the “front line” job most in-demand during the current crisis, took a much smaller hit, while leisure and hospitality services and non-essential retail saw the biggest collapses. This set of facts suggests the economic collapse was not caused solely by the stay-at-home orders, and is therefore unlikely to be undone simply by lifting them.

This video presents a novel technique for embedding optic fibers into a metal blade
to sense objects that the knife is cutting. In particular, we present a design for
a kitchen knife with fiber optics between the edge of the blade and the handle, with
a skin-color sensor that overcomes the complex conditions in the kitchen. Hoping this
design will lead to future work on minimizing cooking injuries, our handheld device
also includes a simple finger-protection mechanism in the form of a retracting blade.
We present our novel hardware design, an initial study of imaging capabilities, and
a discussion of future directions.

The meat industry needs reliable meat quality information throughout the production  process in order to guarantee high-quality meat products for consumers. Besides laboratory researches, food scientists often try to adapt their tools to industrial conditions and easy handling devices useable on-line and in slaughterhouses already exist. This paper overviews the recently developed approaches and latest research efforts related to assessing the quality of different meat products by electromagnetic waves and examines the potential for their deployment. The main meat quality traits that can be assessed using electromagnetic waves are sensory characteristics, chemical composition, physicochemical properties, health-protecting properties, nutritional characteristics and safety. A wide range of techniques, from low frequency, high frequency impedance measurement, microwaves, NMR, IR and UV light, to X-ray interaction, involves a wide range of physical interactions between the electromagnetic wave and the sample. Some of these techniques are now in a period of transition between experimental and applied utilization and several sensors and instruments are reviewed.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
With improvement in people's living standards, many people nowadays pay more  attention to quality and safety of meat. However, traditional methods for meat quality and safety detection and evaluation, such as manual inspection, mechanical methods, and chemical methods, are tedious, time-consuming, and destructive, which cannot meet the requirements of modern meat industry. Therefore, seeking out rapid, non-destructive, and accurate inspection techniques is important for the meat industry. In recent years, a number of novel and noninvasive imaging techniques, such as optical imaging, ultrasound imaging, tomographic imaging, thermal imaging, and odor imaging, have emerged and shown great potential in quality and safety assessment. In this paper, a detailed overview of advanced applications of these emerging imaging techniques for quality and safety assessment of different types of meat (pork, beef, lamb, chicken, and fish) is presented. In addition, advantages and disadvantages of each imaging technique are also summarized. Finally, future trends for these emerging imaging techniques are discussed, including integration of multiple imaging techniques, cost reduction, and developing powerful image-processing algorithms.
