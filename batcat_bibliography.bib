   abstract = {Dipolar interactions play an important role for thermodynamic properties of many fluids and accordingly for their modeling. In molecular-based equation of state models, the effect of dipolar interactions is usually described by Helmholtz energy models. There are several Helmholtz energy models for dipolar interactions available in the literature today. In this work, eight dipole contribution models describing the dipole–dipole interactions of fluids were critically assessed by comparing their results with molecular simulation reference data of Stockmayer fluids. Therefore, the dipole contribution models were combined with an accurate Lennard-Jones (LJ) Helmholtz energy model. The following thermodynamic properties were considered in the comparison: vapor pressure, saturated densities, enthalpy of vaporization, surface tension (by using density gradient theory), critical point, second virial coefficient, and thermodynamic properties at homogeneous state points, such as the Helmholtz energy, pressure, chemical potential, internal energy, isochoric heat capacity, isobaric heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient, isothermal compressibility, thermal pressure coefficient, speed of sound, Joule–Thomson coefficient, and Grüneisen parameter. For the evaluation of the dipole contribution models, molecular simulations for the Stockmayer fluid with the dipole moments of μ2/4πϵ0ɛσ3=0.5,1,2,3,4,5 were carried out. The results indicate, that all considered dipole models exhibit some significant weaknesses. Nevertheless, some dipole contribution models are found to provide a robust description for many properties and state ranges. Overall, the deviations of the dipole contribution models from the Stockmayer simulation data are, in most cases, an order of magnitude higher than the deviations of the LJ EOS from LJ simulation data.},

   abstract = {Growing concerns over the lack of transparency in AI, particularly in high-stakes fields like healthcare and finance, drive the need for explainable and trustworthy systems. While Large Language Models (LLMs) perform exceptionally well in generating accurate outputs, their "black box" nature poses significant challenges to transparency and trust. To address this, the paper proposes the TranspNet pipeline, which integrates symbolic AI with LLMs. By leveraging domain expert knowledge, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and formal reasoning frameworks like Answer Set Programming (ASP), TranspNet enhances LLM outputs with structured reasoning and verification. This approach ensures that AI systems deliver not only accurate but also explainable and trustworthy results, meeting regulatory demands for transparency and accountability. TranspNet provides a comprehensive solution for developing AI systems that are reliable and interpretable, making it suitable for real-world applications where trust is critical.},

   abstract = {Open innovation in materials research involves the collaborative sharing of knowledge, ideas, and resources across organisations. Unfortunately, a lack of mutual understanding between scientific and industrial partners and their respective domain-specific digital tools hampers collaboration across the two domains. For this purpose, this work integrates the Business Process Modelling and Notation standard BPMN and the Elementary Multi-perspective Material Ontology (EMMO), yielding a knowledge representation and data documentation standard for research problems, workflows, and results related to the development of new materials and technologies and the underlying challenges in materials science. As a methodology, this work proposes and implements an innovative four-step approach for ontology integration, comprising alignment, mapping, integration, and validation. The result of this integration is pioneering an original Materials-based Business Case Ontology (MBCO), by which BPMN can be deployed an EMMO-compliant way.},

The relative expanded uncertainty of the experimental data is below 0.2%. The new results significantly extend the available literature data. The density of the five alcohols was modeled using four molecular-based equations of state (EOSs), namely PC-SAFT, SAFT-VR Mie, soft SAFT, and CPA. New component-specific EOS models were parametrized for all considered EOSs and substances using vapor-liquid equilibrium data from the literature and the density data from this work. The resulting EOS models describe the density with deviations of about 0.2-1.5%. For the thermal second-order derivative properties, the relative deviations were 10-50% for the isothermal compressibility and 5-35% for the thermal expansion coefficient. Also, the extrapolation behavior of the EOS models was assessed. Overall, the best results were obtained from the SAFT-VR Mie EOS.},

   abstract = {Brown’s characteristic curves of polar fluids were studied using molecular simulation and molecular-based equation of state. The focus was on elucidating the influence of dipole interactions and the molecule elongation on the characteristic curves. This was studied using the symmetric two-center Lennard–Jones plus point dipole (2CLJD) model fluid class. This model class has two parameters (using Lennard–Jones reduced units), namely the elongation and the dipole moment. These parameters were varied in the range relevant for real substance models that are based on the 2CLJD model class. In total, 43 model fluids were studied. Interestingly, the elongation is found to have a stronger influence on the characteristic curves compared to the dipole moment. Most importantly, the characteristic curve results for the 2CLJD fluid are fully conform with Brown’s postulates (which were originally derived for simple spherical dispersive fluids). The independent predictions from the computer experiments and the theory are found to be in reasonable agreement. From the molecular simulation results, an empirical correlation for the characteristic curves of the 2CLJD model as a function of the model parameters was developed and also applied for modeling real substances. Additionally, the intersection points of the Charles and Boyle curve with the vapor-liquid equilibrium binodal and spinodal, respectively, were studied.},

   abstract = {Summary. The European Materials and Modelling Ontology (EMMO) has recently been advanced in the computational molecular engineering and multiscale modelling communities as a top-level ontology, aiming to support semantic interoperability and data integration solutions, e.g., for research data infrastructures. The present work explores how top-level ontologies that are based on the same paradigm – the same set of fundamental postulates – as the EMMO can be applied to models of physical systems and their use in computational engineering practice. This paradigm, which combines mereology (in its extension as mereotopology) and semiotics (following Peirce’s approach), is here referred to as mereosemiotics. Multiple conceivable ways of implementing mereosemiotics are compared, and the design space consisting of the possible types of top-level ontologies following this paradigm is characterized.},

   abstract = {In many industrial applications as well as in nature, the mass transfer of CO2 at vapor-liquid interfaces in aqueous systems plays an important role. In this work, this process was studied on the atomistic level using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. In a first step, a molecular model of the system water + CO2 was developed that represents both bulk and interfacial equilibrium properties well. This system is characterized by a very large adsorption and enrichment of CO2 at the vapor-liquid interface. Then, non-equilibrium mass transfer simulations were carried out using a method that was developed recently: CO2 is inserted into the vapor phase of a simulation box which contains a liquid slab. Surprising effects are observed at the interface such as a net repulsion of CO2 particles from the interface and a complex time dependence of the amount of CO2 adsorbed at the interface.},

   abstract = {Neural-symbolic learning, an intersection of neural networks and symbolic reasoning, aims to blend neural networks' learning capabilities with symbolic AI's interpretability and reasoning. This paper introduces an approach designed to improve the performance of neural models in learning reasoning tasks. It achieves this by integrating Answer Set Programming (ASP) solvers and domain-specific expertise, which is an approach that diverges from traditional complex neural-symbolic models. In this paper, a shallow artificial neural network (ANN) is specifically trained to solve Sudoku puzzles with minimal training data. The model has a unique loss function that integrates losses calculated using the ASP solver outputs, effectively enhancing its training efficiency. Most notably, the model shows a significant improvement in solving Sudoku puzzles using only 12 puzzles for training and testing without hyperparameter tuning. This advancement indicates that the model's enhanced reasoning capabilities have practical applications, extending well beyond Sudoku puzzles to potentially include a variety of other domains.

The proposed approach is flexible and applicable to both regression and classification tasks, demonstrating generalizability across various fields such as healthcare, autonomous systems, engineering, and battery manufacturing applications. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, the strength of our approach lies in its scalability across different domains.
